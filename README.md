  This is the first stage of the ISS Tracker app. <Br>
  This app will let you see the realtime location of the International Space Station. <br>
  The current version includes code only for the home screen.<br>
<br>
  I'm currently using react-native snack to build the <a href="https://snack.expo.dev/@dhritid/iss-tracker-s1">ISS Location Tracker</a>.
 Here, I've used Stack Navigation to navigate from one screen to another efficiently.

    I will be uploading further versions of the app from time to time.
